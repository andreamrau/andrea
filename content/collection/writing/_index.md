One of the primary avenues for disseminating research results is through 
peer-reviewed scientific journals, but pre-prints have become an increasingly 
common way to share results quickly and openly. In this section, you can find 
references and links for

- Peer-reviewed articles
- Books, book chapters, and dissertations
- Preprints, submitted articles, and technical reports.
