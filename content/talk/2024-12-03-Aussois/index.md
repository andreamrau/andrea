excerpt: The increasing availability and affordability of high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the generation of large-scale multi-omic data, greatly enhancing our understanding of complex biological systems across hierarchical molecular levels. A great deal of attention has been devoted to developing integrative methods that can fully leverage these multifaceted data, despite numerous statistical challenges such as small sample sizes, high dimensionality, heterogeneous measures, missing data, and complex interdependencies within and between omic layers. To date, many multi-omic integrative approaches have been proposed, reflecting the diversity of omics combinations, definitions of inter-omic anchors, and analysis objectives. In this talk, I will provide an overview of some commonly used methods for multi-omics integration, and I will introduce one of our own recent contributions in this field -- idiffomix, a joint mixture model for integrated differential analyses of paired transcriptomic and methylation data. I will conclude by discussing some future opportunities and challenges in integrative multi-omics research.
